grandpa.htb

First thing I notice is we cannot ping grandpa.htb
nmap -Pn grandpa.htb to avoid the testing portion of the scan

our result is port 80 is open
nmap -sV -p 80 grandpa.htb returns
        80/tcp, open, http, Microsoft IIS httpd 6.0
That is the answer to our first question

Next we need to find a CVE specific to the IIS 6.0 version.
We found CVE-2017-7269
        This is a result of a Buffer Overflow vulnerbility from an improper validation of the IF header in a PROPFIND request
        An attacker could exploit this in the IIS WebDAV Component with a crafted request using PROPFIND
        It can result in DoS or remote code execution

Next question they are looking for a metasploit module that can be used against this version
If we search for 7269, we get the result for exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl

Next, there is supposed to be a recon module that will list possible privilege escalation paths on the system
looking in the post/multi/recon module, we found local_exploit_suggester

using the first exploit in msfconsole, we adjust the options to point to grandpa.htb
We get a successful session, however we cannot read any user data in C:\Documents and Settings
This is where we will need to use the other module

we set it in another terminal, and all we have to pass is the session as an option
I set the session to one per my other shell, however it doesn't show that it's found
We use the command "background" to set this current session in the background as sessoin one
then, we use local_exploit_suggester setting the session to 1
there are 6 total exploits that show up as potentially vulnerable
         1   exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d                        Yes                      
         2   exploit/windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu                Yes                      
         3   exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl                     Yes                      
         4   exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image               Yes                      
         5   exploit/windows/local/ms16_016_webdav                          Yes                      
         6   exploit/windows/local/ppr_flatten_rec                          Yes 
researching each one, tcpip_ioctl contains privilege escalation

I use /windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl now and set the session to 1 and my local IP in the OpenVPN network
we now send the exploit
this seems to time out on both my sessions

I went back into session 1 and it timed out, I re-established my session by re-running the exploit for scstoragepathfromurl

I now have a root shell!
The flags are relatively easy to find from here
